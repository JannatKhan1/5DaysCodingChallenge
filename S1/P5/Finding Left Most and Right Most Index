Problem 5: Find LeftMost and RighMost Index In Array
Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements. The task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element X in the given array.
Note: If the element is not present in the array return {-1,-1} as pair.

Logic/Idea : This problem is solved similar to the problem 4 except for one minor change. Once finding first, our search continues in left half, and conversely for last, once we find last,we continue search in right.

Algorithm:
Same as problem 4 with slight changes:
1. Two different searches, one for first index and one for last index.
2. For first index, continue the search in left range, set high = mid - 1.
3. For last index, continue the search in right range, set low = mid + 1.

Lessons Learnt:
1. How to implement the logic used in previous problems with additional changes.
2. How to narrow the search range as per need.
3. For an sorted array - ALWAYS TRY Binary search TO GET THE SOLUTION.
