Problem 3: Find Index Of Extra Element In Array
Given two sorted arrays of distinct elements. There is only 1 difference between the arrays. First array has one element extra added in between. Find the index of the extra element.
Solution:
Logic :
1. Use XOR operations to find extra element.
2. After extra element is found, search for its index using for loop and return index.

Lessons Learnt:
1. XOR of a number with itself is 0.
2. XOR of a number with 0 is number.
3. To avoid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, an if statement is added to array with less number of elements.
